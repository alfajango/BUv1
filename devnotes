Building 8rate from a rails 3.1, mongoid, devise, bootstrap barebones app

Start with code/8ratev1_pre_theme

compare to John's sample_user_auth:

In 8ratev1_pre_theme, add a bunch of html from divshot to application.html.erb

I'm calling it BumptUp now.  I have spider blocker on.  

BU logo is http://i.imgur.com/0Pua12E.png

my git is pretty messed up in this project.  I dont think I had github going on 8ratev1_pre_theme.  then I branched to BUv1.  

So, SWITCH TO BUv1 repo and BUv1 folder on my local drive (code/BUv1).  Branch is main

3/19/14 - come back to this one after a couple months to get Devise and Mongo

To start this project, 
1 tab: BUv1 $ rails s
2nd tab: BUv1 $ mongod
go to localhost:3000

It looks like I can create create a user, but there are no pages other than the landing page

What I need to do:
- put in one view at a time, keep everything working
- put in models projects first?


$ rails generate controller Attributes  # didn't do no-test-framework
$ rails generate model Attribute attribute_name:string category:string identifier:integer
# assuming I don't need to rake db:migrate

$ rails g controller Feedbacks
    conflict  app/controllers/feedbacks_controller.rb
Overwrite /Users/philgarber/code/BUv1/app/controllers/feedbacks_controller.rb? (enter "h" for help) [Ynaqdh] n
$ rails g model Feedback from_id:integer to_id:integer attribute_identifier rating_given:float accounted_for:datetime 

to view my db, open MongoHub.  go to the right table on the left, then hit Query.  Then Run in the window that pops up

$ rails g controller Companies
$ rails g model Company domain:string name:string
$ rails g controller Projects
    conflict  app/controllers/projects_controller.rb
Overwrite /Users/philgarber/code/BUv1/app/controllers/projects_controller.rb? (enter "h" for help) [Ynaqdh] n
$ rails g model Project name:string company_id:integer
$ rails g controller ProjectFeedbacks  # forgot to add columns
$ rails g controller ProjectRatings
$ rails g model ProjectRating project_id:integer project_attribute_identifier:integer current_rating:float num_fb_received:float 
$ rails g controller ProjectAttributes
$ rails g model ProjectAttribute name:strin

change a bunch of things to belongs_to or has_many in the models files
