Building 8rate from a rails 3.1, mongoid, devise, bootstrap barebones app

Start with code/8ratev1_pre_theme

compare to John's sample_user_auth:

In 8ratev1_pre_theme, add a bunch of html from divshot to application.html.erb

I'm calling it BumptUp now.  I have spider blocker on.  

BU logo is http://i.imgur.com/0Pua12E.png

my git is pretty messed up in this project.  I dont think I had github going on 8ratev1_pre_theme.  then I branched to BUv1.  

So, SWITCH TO BUv1 repo and BUv1 folder on my local drive (code/BUv1).  Branch is main
